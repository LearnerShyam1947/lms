Hello {{ user.name }},

I hope this email finds you well. This is a gentle reminder that your due on checked out book is going to expire soon.
The checked out book details:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Book Title</th>
        <td>{{ book.name }}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Author</th>
        <td>{{ book.author }}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Checked out Date</th>
        <td>{{ time.strftime('%B %d, %Y %H:%M') }}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Due Date</th>
        <td>{{ due_date.strftime('%B %d, %Y') }}</td>
    </tr>
</table>

As your due is going to expire by tomorrow, I hope you will return the book in your library as fast as possible. 
Thanks for using your services.

Best regards,
Team LMS
